# TwoFileProject
A simple project with two files.

A simple calculator project with two files: `program1.py` and `utilities.py`.

## Files

- `program1.py`: This file contains the main program logic for a basic GUI calculator using Tkinter. It includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `utilities.py`: This file contains a utility function `is_float` that checks if a given string can be converted to a float. It is used for input validation in `program1.py`.

## How to Run
